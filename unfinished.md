<h1>Unfinished cups of iced water</h1>
<p>
  Unfinished cups of ice water<br>
now neutral to the touch<br>
stand at different levels<br>
shoulder to shoulder on the counter. 

The water<br>
and the emptiness<br>
and the vessel<br>
are one

just as the negative space in trees<br>
where wind plays<br>
becomes dapples of light<br>
on the pavement.

Shadows falling down<br>
cut sharper than any knife<br>
but land more gently<br> 
than any leaf.

Untouched by time where<br>
water cannot flow<br>
looking out and<br>
looking through-

perhaps I prefer<br>
the blackbird whistling.

I have always said<br>
just after.
