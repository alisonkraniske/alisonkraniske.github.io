<h1>Unfinsihed cups of iced water</h1>
<p>
  Unfinished cups of ice water<br>
now neutral to the touch
stand at different levels
shoulder to shoulder on the counter. 

The water
and the emptiness
and the vessel
are one

just as the negative space in trees
where wind plays
becomes dapples of light
on the pavement.

Shadows falling down
cut sharper than any knife
but land more gently 
than any leaf.

Untouched by time where
water cannot flow
looking out and
looking through-

perhaps I prefer
the blackbird whistling.

I have always said
just after.
